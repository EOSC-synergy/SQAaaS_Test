## deployment
To run the server open a terminal in the server folder and run 'npm run server', it will connect to the mongodb database and run the backend at port 5000.
Now open a Terminal in the client folder and run "npm run style" to activate sass and make it look for live changes in the style.
Then open a terminal in the client folder (right clic on the client folder and then clic on 'Open in Integrated Terminal') an run 'npm start', this will launch the react frontend and will open your browser at localhost:3000, there you should see the actual website which will be automatically updated as soon as you change something in the frontend.

Oppure andare nella root del progetto e runnare npm start, aprirà 3 terminal esterni (uno per il server, uno per sass e uno per react) e infine si aprirà il sito su una pagina a parte.
